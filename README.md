# Hi, I'm Siddartha Silveri ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a 2024 B.Tech graduate from MLR Institute of Technology, where I specialized in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE). After graduation, I developed a deep interest in data and data analysis, which led me to dive into learning various tools and techniques to analyze, visualize, and derive insights from data.
- Currently, I'm focusing on expanding my knowledge in data analysis and continuously working on projects that reflect my learning journey. You can find all my data-related projects here on my GitHub profile, showcasing my progress and commitment to this exciting field.
- Feel free to explore my repositories, and let's connect if you'd like to discuss data, technology, or collaboration opportunities!
